# Linux Terminal Server Project

Linux Terminal Server Project helps in netbooting LAN clients from a single
template installation that resides in a virtual machine image or a chroot
on the LTSP server, or the server root (/, chrootless). This way maintaining
tens or hundreds of diskless clients is as easy as maintaining a single PC.
